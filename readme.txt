What is this!?
It's a project I was working on for fun and really enjoyed it.

This game was originally intended to work for touch devices.

I was working on this back in 2017 for a while, but decided to pursue other things.

I really enjoyed making this as it is not complete I do plan on finishing this and hopefully I can even start making better games.

Feel free to play this monstrosity (haha!). I liked the story myself.

I may share the apk version pretty soon.

I used rpg maker mv for anyone wondering.

Note: This was from a cloud save as the computer I used to work on this with I no longer own.
There are typos and scripts that aren't supposed to occur early in game that I'll have to patch soon.
